## Projects

### Project 1: Hospital Readmission [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Hospital%20Readmission)
Predicting if a diabetes patient will be readmitted to the hospital.  

### Project 2: Adaptable CNN [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Adaptable%20CNN/CNN.ipynb)
I wanted to find a good CNN structure for [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) image data, instead of constraining myself to redefining the model for all architecures,  
I developed a function that accepts a list of configurations, and automatically builds tests performance.  
Configurable paramaters include: Optimizer, Learning Rate, Batch Size, Padding, layer count, and data augmentation rules.
Per-Layer paramaters: (conv/dense), filter size, filter count, batchnorm, activation, dropout, and maxpool.

### Project 3: Parts of Speech Recognition [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Parts%20Of%20Speech/PartsOfSpeech.ipynb)
Here, features for classifing parts of speech were generated.  
OpenAI's text-davinci API was used to generate more abstract features.  

### Project 4: 3D Reconstruction from Images [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/VoxelGrid/VoxelGrid.ipynb)
This is a Voxel-Based Reconstruction of a dancer from 8 images taken in the same moment.  
A blank grid was populated from the images, where texture was later applied.

### Project 5: Panorama Stitching [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Panorama%20Stitching/Panorama%20Stiching.ipynb)
Developed a computer vision project to stitch two photos without using external functions.

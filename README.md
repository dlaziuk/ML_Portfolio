## Projects

### Project 1: Hospital Readmission [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Hospital%20Readmission)
Predicting if a diabetes patient will be readmitted to the hospital.  

### Project 2: Parts of Speech Recognition [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Parts%20Of%20Speech/PartsOfSpeech.ipynb)
Here, features for classifing parts of speech were generated.  
OpenAI's text-davinci API was used to generate more abstract features.  

### Project 3: Panorama Stitching [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Panorama%20Stitching/Panorama%20Stiching.ipynb)
Developed a computer vision project to stitch two photos without using external functions.

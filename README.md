### Transformers in Financial NLP: Market Movements from 8-K reports [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Transformers%20in%20Financial%20NLP/Financial%20NLP.ipynb)
This project was designed to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing financial documents, specifically the 8-K reports of S&P 500 companies. The primary goal was to utilize Transformer models and advanced data processing techniques to predict market movements, offering a novel financial indicator.

Key Achievements:
1. Advanced Data Preprocessing:
 - Employed sophisticated text preprocessing strategies to handle massive datasets of 8-K reports, ensuring the retention of crucial financial information.
 - Pioneered the use of tailored feature engineering methods to extract and emphasize the most relevant textual elements, significantly enhancing the model's accuracy and predictive relevance.
2. Innovative Use of Transformer Models:
 - Successfully adapted and fine-tuned the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, tailoring it specifically for regression with financial text analysis.
 - Developed a method to adapt this advanced language model to the domain of finance, focusing on extracting pivotal insights from complex financial documents.
 - Currently engaged in ongoing experimentation with other Transformer models like FinBERT, XLNet, and GPT variants, aiming to broaden the scope and enhance the accuracy of financial text analysis.
3. Novel Market Sentiment Indicator:
 - Created a unique market sentiment indicator through meticulous model training, ensuring that it captures subtle nuances in the financial reports.
 - Demonstrated exceptional skill in model optimization, leveraging dropout techniques and linear regression layers for improved efficiency and performance.
4. Data Analysis and Visualization:
 - Conducted a thorough statistical analysis of the financial data, employing histograms, line plots, and correlation matrices to uncover deeper insights.
5. Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation:
 - Established baseline performances with traditional machine learning models, such as Naive Predictions, Linear Regression, and SVMs.
 - Rigorously evaluated the Transformer models against these baselines, using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and Directional Accuracy, where the Transformer models consistently outperformed the baselines.

### Time Series Analysis: Analyzing Daily SPY ETF Data and Monthly Solar Production  [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/GARCH%2C%20ARMA%2C%20SARMA/TSAPaper.pdf)
Conducted a comprehensive time series analysis on two distinct datasets: the daily adjusted close prices of the SPY ETF (non-seasonal) and the monthly solar production at the Southland Leisure Centre in Canada (seasonal).  
Preprocessed data using Python and performed the analysis with the R programming language. Verified non-seasonality and tested stationarity in the financial data. Applied different transformations, ARIMA, and GARCH models in the attempt to create accurate forecasts.  
Although GARCH models failed to provide satisfactory forecasts, a rolling mean detrending technique followed by the application of an ARMA(2,1) model led to successful forecasting of the SPY ETF prices. This demonstrated adaptability in employing different techniques to overcome analytical challenges.  
For the seasonal dataset, confirmed the presence of seasonality, performed seasonal differencing, and tested various SARIMA models. The best fitting SARIMA model provided accurate forecasts of the solar production data.  
Demonstrated advanced statistical forecasting techniques' effectiveness in addressing unique challenges posed by each dataset. The ability to accurately forecast both SPY ETF prices and solar production volumes can provide valuable insights for investment strategies, risk management, and renewable energy sector management, offering significant value to businesses in these areas.  

### Adaptable CNN [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Adaptable%20CNN/CNN.ipynb)
I wanted to find a good CNN structure for [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) image data, instead of constraining myself to redefining the model for all architecures,  
I developed a function that accepts a list of configurations, and automatically builds tests performance.  
Configurable paramaters include: Optimizer, Learning Rate, Batch Size, Padding, layer count, and data augmentation rules.
Per-Layer paramaters: (conv/dense), filter size, filter count, batchnorm, activation, dropout, and maxpool.

### Hospital Readmission [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Hospital%20Readmission)
Predicting if a diabetes patient will be readmitted to the hospital.  

### Parts of Speech Recognition [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Parts%20Of%20Speech/PartsOfSpeech.ipynb)
Here, features for classifing parts of speech were generated.  
OpenAI's text-davinci API was used to generate more abstract features.  

### Reconstruction from Images [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/VoxelGrid/VoxelGrid.ipynb)
This is a Voxel-Based Reconstruction of a dancer from 8 images taken in the same moment.  
A blank grid was populated from the images, where texture was later applied.

### Panorama Stitching [link](https://github.com/dlaziuk/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Panorama%20Stitching/Panorama%20Stiching.ipynb)
Developed a computer vision project to stitch two photos without using advanced external libraries.
